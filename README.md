Code used for the master thesis "Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning for strategy extraction in the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game"

The code is available for consultation purposes. Most of it has not been properly documented or structured for external use, but if someone would be interested to use concepts of the thesis, they can always contact me and I will gladly run them through the code.

There are 3 main files:
The ThesisPlots and ThesisAnalysis files are notebooks used to generate plots and gain insights in data.
The source folder is a Python project (made on Pycharm 2020.3.3 with Python 3.7 interpreter) with the code of the actual agent

Note that the data is not included, as I am not the owner of the dataset that was made available for the purposes of this thesis.
